Zeek Training Source Material
=============================

This repository contains resources for trainings held by the Zeek project. There
are currently two types of training, in respective subdirectories:

- Introduction To Running Zeek, also in the past called "Intermediate to
  Zeek". This covers how to install Zeek, contains a walkthrough of the Zeek
  ecosystem, and focuses on how to get a cluster up and running.
  
- Hands-on Scripting. This is a deep-dive into programming Zeek with the Zeek
  scripting language, aimed at users who want to move beyond deploying Zeek
  as-is and who want to write their own custom Zeek scripts.

In each subdirectory, READMEs provide additional information regarding where to
find additional training resources. The repositories contains additional
branches for older events, to avoid duplicating the same material into mostly
redundant folders over time.
