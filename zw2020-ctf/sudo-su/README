sudo su
=======
This is another easy one. The pcap contains a single ssh session.

The user authenticated with a public key.
The user was then provided a pseudo-terminal on the server.
The user entered the "sudo su" command.
The user then typed their passowrd and successfully elevated to root.
The user then pressed CTL+D twice which exited first the root and then the user's ssh session.

All we want to know is the length of the user's password. It's a number.
YOU ONLY GET 2 ATTEMPTS. DON'T WASTE THEM.
