Man or Machine?
===============
This one is simple. There's a pcap which contains 100 SSH connections. 
Only 1 of the connections was human driven. The rest weren't.
All we want to know is the source port number for that 1 connection.
You ONLY have 2 attempts, so don't bruteforce guess!

All the connections used the same client, server, and configurations.
If everything is the same and the payload contents are encrypted, what else could you compare?
