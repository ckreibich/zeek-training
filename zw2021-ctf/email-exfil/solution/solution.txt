A PDF is encrypted with a random password, provided by a webservice over TLS. The TLS stream's decryption keys along with the encrypted PDF is exfiltrated via a Python script which sends email. Participants are given a pcap trace file, they are expected to carve the SSLKEYLOGFILE and encrypted PDF from the pcap, use the SSLKEYLOGFILE with Wireshark to decrypt the TLS stream carrying the PDF's password, and decrypt the PDF which reveals the flag.
