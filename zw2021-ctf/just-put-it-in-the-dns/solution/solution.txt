EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)[1] is an extension to the DNS that allows a DNS
recursive (in this pcap, 8.8.8.8) to include a subnet that contains the
requesting client. solution/solution.zeek will output the relevant information,
or you can see it in Wireshark in the Additional responses.

This is used to improve content delivery so it's optimized
for the local address, which in the Internet of today is not likely to be
"close" to the resolver. Note the difference between the recursive IP and
the reported subnet. This can have privacy implications[2].
