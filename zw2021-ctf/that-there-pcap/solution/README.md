README was taken from https://github.com/zeek/zeek-docs/blob/ac82bd62c4b67d1c13540730a85c6a824397832c/README

It was then placed into a tarball with: `tar zfc r.tgz README`

The tarball was transfered via netcat and the connection was recorded with tcpdump.


NOTE! Zeek's file extraction doesn't quite work with things transfered via netcat :(
