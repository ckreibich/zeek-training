Testing #2
==========

The year was 1998. It was a dark and stormy Friday night. The end of a gritty cup of coffee sat in the middle of a dimly lit desk.
As the clock on the wall was quickly approaching midnight, Zeek's inventor was frantically typing the first message to be sent to the (then Bro) mailing list.
Some say it was warning of what was to come. Others have yet to decipher the meaning of the message.

Your challenge, and the flag for this puzzle, is to submit the body of the cryptic email.
