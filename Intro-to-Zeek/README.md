==========================================

The slides accompanying this training are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11UidS9npqvTF7Cv2-8OQMDh-7u1gXWxS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117138985048955853206&rtpof=true&sd=true).

This training assumes you have familiarity with Docker and can work with a
Docker container running the latest Zeek LTS release, available from

https://hub.docker.com/u/zeek

via "docker run -it zeek/zeek:lts". Clone this repository in the container to
get started. The setup.sh script prepares additional needed tooling for the
various exercises.
